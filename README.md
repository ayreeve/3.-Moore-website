# Moore-website

Website designed and created for imaginary company named Moore (yes, two ‘o’). Selected fabrics, unique cut, attention to details, and other bla bla bla. In fact, you only need to know that Moore is cool fashion company which allows its employee (I mean, ‘designers’) to place a bath time selfie on the main page (only if they look artistic enough). What am I writing about? See the website to understand.

Used:
- HTML,
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- RWD
- Grunt, Git

What’s more?
- my own design and logo (which is literally given to you by a Moore hands)
